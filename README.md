# Skeletonization

The code skeletonizes a character image.
The algorithm of the skeletonization has appeared in Fujita 2013.
You can look at the sample image in [the page](https://github.com/KazuhisaFujita/skeletonization/blob/main/test.ipynb).

Now, there are several differences between the code and the paper.
Furthermore, we can find not-optimal descriptions in the codes.
I will fix the codes and the paper later.
